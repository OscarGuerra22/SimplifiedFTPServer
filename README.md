# Simplified FTP Server

## Overview
This project is a simplified FTP server implemented in C++, following the FTP standard as outlined in the attached documentation within the repository. The server supports fundamental FTP functionalities, allowing clients to connect, authenticate, transfer files, and manage directories.

This project was developed as part of an assignment for the **"Redes y Sistemas Distribuidos"** course (translated as **Networks and Distributed Systems**).

## Features
- Implementation of core FTP commands (e.g., `USER`, `PASS`, `LIST`, `RETR`, `STOR`).
- Supports both **active** and **passive** FTP modes.

## Installation
### Requirements
- A POSIX-compliant system (Linux/macOS recommended) or Windows with MinGW
- Make (for build configuration)

## Acknowledgments
This project is a fork of my university repository and was developed as an academic assignment, basic structure of the code was given to us.
